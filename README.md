# Auto-MPG
Sample program from Predictive Analytics for dummies by Anasse Bari, PhD, Mohamed Chaouchi and Tommy Jung.
Auto-MPG is a dataset that has 398 observations along with a label and nine attributes. The expected outcome is assigned to the 
label; the training and evaluation of the precision of the predictive model will use the label. The outcome that the model is 
designed to predict is the expected mpg (attribute 1) of an auto, when given the attribute values.

The dataset from the UCI repository located at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data
The data is from Bache, K. & Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA.

This model uses a regression algorithm to predict the fuel economy expressed as miles per gallon for an auto.
